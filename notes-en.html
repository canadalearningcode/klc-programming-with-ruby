        #Using Ruby

        <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> is an open-source programming language that can be used to communicate anything from a simple mathematical equation, to an interactive game. We will use <a href="https://repl.it/languages/ruby">repl.it</a>, a free, cloud coding environment, to make our programs come to life. Here are a few resources to get you started:

        * <a href="http://tryruby.org/levels/1">Ruby tutorial</a> for beginners

        #Introduction

        ##Kick-Off Script

        Welcome to our Kids Learning Code workshop: Programming with Ruby! We’re so glad that you could be here today and hope you’re ready to learn lots of new things.

        How many of you have been to one of our workshops or camps before?
        (If you get some hands up, ask a few of them what workshops they attended)

        We started running our first programs for kids with Girls Learning Code workshops and camps back in 2012, and then since we had so many people asking if boys could come too we started Kids Learning Code a year later in 2013. Since then, we’ve expanded to over 29 cities across Canada and have taught over 19,000 kids how to code!

        Before we get started with our workshop, there are a few things we need to go over:

        * <strong>Washrooms:</strong> Can everyone please point in the direction of the washrooms? (clarify where they are located) If you need to go to the washroom, please go with your parent/guardian or go with another learner.
        * <strong>Water:</strong> If you brought a water bottle with you, you’re welcome to keep it on your desk, but make sure to keep the lid closed when you’re not using it.
        * <strong>Break/snacks:</strong> We’ll have a break mid-way through when you can eat any snacks you brought with you or just stretch your legs. If you have a (peanut free) snack, please eat it out front and clean up any crumbs or wrappers when you’re done.

        #Code-Along

        * Go through each step using the slides (after "Let's Get Coding!") while the group follows along.
        * If there is a whiteboard, write down main functions as you go, as a reference for the work session (or have a mentor help out with this)
        * For the Guessing Game, go through one list item at a time, and give learners a chance to figure out the code on their own, before asking a volunteer to share their solution with the group.
        * Have the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11BLTteUOJkLSPeBCjUgjcNH13h9MiosryJKSN6YE5xg/edit?usp=sharing">Code-Along Challenges</a> handy for mentors to give to learners that are ahead
        * Remind learners to save often!

        #Work Session

        <!--* Select a game or puzzle from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tw2aJOtyzZv7ODoQbyrDqRgQzkNWukmalKcCUf9LabI/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Choose-Your-Own-Adventure. (be sure to paste the steps and solution into the slides ahead of time)-->

        * Get learners started by creating a new project (Click on the repl.it logo, then select “New Session”)
        * Get the project started code-along style, then leave the STEPS slide up on the screen
        * Check in with the group every 10-20 minutes to see if there are any questions. Have learners come up and share their solutions whenever possible.
        * Remind learners to save often!
        * Leave time at the end for learners to share their projects with each other. Recommended: Have a Gallery Walk, where learners open the project on their screens, tuck in their chairs, and walk around to see each other's work.

        <table style="font-size:2rem;">

        </table>

        <br>
        #Unplugged Activity (Optional)

        If you notice that the group is needing a break, give them 10 minutes to use the washroom, get some water, or grab a snack from their bags. Another option is to run an unplugged activity midway through the workshop to get them out of their seats and moving around. Unplugged activities usually take around 10 minutes to run. Choose an unplugged activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Do The Robot.

        <br>
        #Closing Script

        Who can tell me something new they learned today? (<strong>*Refer to slide 36 for examples</strong>. If you don’t get any hands up, you can either ask a specific kid that was definitely engaged during the workshop, or review a couple of the key lessons in the workshop)

        You all did an amazing job and we’re really impressed with how great your projects turned out.

        If you want to learn more about coding, design, and technology, go onto our site kidslearningcode.com to check out all of our upcoming workshops and join our mailing list. (Announce next workshop and give short description).

        Before we go, let’s give our mentors a big hand!

        Thanks and we hope to see you all in another workshop soon!

      #Code-Along

      * Go through each step using the slides (after "Let's Get Coding!") while the group follows along.
      * If there is a whiteboard, write down main functions as you go, as a reference for the work session (or have a mentor help out with this)
      * For the Guessing Game, go through one list item at a time, and give learners a chance to figure out the code on their own, before asking a volunteer to share their solution with the group.
      * Have the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11BLTteUOJkLSPeBCjUgjcNH13h9MiosryJKSN6YE5xg/edit?usp=sharing">Code-Along Challenges</a> handy for mentors to give to learners that are ahead
      * Remind learners to save often!

      #Work Session

      <!--* Select a game or puzzle from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tw2aJOtyzZv7ODoQbyrDqRgQzkNWukmalKcCUf9LabI/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Choose-Your-Own-Adventure. (be sure to paste the steps and solution into the slides ahead of time)-->

      * Get learners started by creating a new project (Click on the repl.it logo, then select “New Session”)
      * Get the project started code-along style, then leave the STEPS slide up on the screen
      * Check in with the group every 10-20 minutes to see if there are any questions. Have learners come up and share their solutions whenever possible.
      * Remind learners to save often!
      * Leave time at the end for learners to share their projects with each other. Recommended: Have a Gallery Walk, where learners open the project on their screens, tuck in their chairs, and walk around to see each other's work.

      #Unplugged Activity (Optional)

      If you notice that the group is needing a break, give them 10 minutes to use the washroom, get some water, or grab a snack from their bags. Another option is to run an unplugged activity midway through the workshop to get them out of their seats and moving around. Unplugged activities usually take around 10 minutes to run. Choose an unplugged activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Do The Robot.

      #Closing Script

      Who can tell me something new they learned today? (<strong>*Refer to slide 36 for examples</strong>. If you don’t get any hands up, you can either ask a specific kid that was definitely engaged during the workshop, or review a couple of the key lessons in the workshop)

      You all did an amazing job and we’re really impressed with how great your projects turned out.

      If you want to learn more about coding, design, and technology, go onto our site kidslearningcode.com to check out all of our upcoming workshops and join our mailing list. (Announce next workshop and give short description).

      Before we go, let’s give our mentors a big hand!

      Thanks and we hope to see you all in another workshop soon!
